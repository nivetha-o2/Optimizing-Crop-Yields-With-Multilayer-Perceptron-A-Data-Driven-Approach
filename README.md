
# Optimizing Crop Yields With Multilayer Perceptron: A Data-Driven Approach

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing crop yields using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks. Leveraging a data-driven approach, the project aims to enhance agricultural productivity through advanced machine learning techniques.

## Project Objectives

- **Predict Crop Yields:** Utilize MLP to forecast crop yields based on various agricultural parameters.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze and preprocess agricultural data to ensure high-quality input for the model.
- **Model Implementation:** Develop and train an MLP model to predict crop yields with improved accuracy.
- **Evaluation:** Compare model performance with other machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective approach.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Gather and preprocess agricultural data, including parameters like soil nutrients, weather conditions, and crop types.
- **MLP Implementation:** Build and train an MLP model using Python and popular machine learning libraries.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance using relevant metrics and visualization tools.
